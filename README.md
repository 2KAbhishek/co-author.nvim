## What is this

How many times have you been working on a piece of code with someone and then when committing you ask their full name and email address for adding a Co-author to the commit?

Upgrade to 21st century, use this plugin to automatically fetch author details from your commit history and then add to your commit message.

It shows you a list of all the unique authors in your current repo.

`co-author.nvim` automatically works with telescope and presents the list in a nice fuzzy searchable UI.
